- form: [JS Data Visualization Submission Form](/)
  
Challenge de consolidation effectué en solo lors de ma formation chez beCode en novembre 2023. 
Il s'agit d'un exercice qui simule une situation de la vie réelle et dont les objectifs d'entrainement sont les suivants:
- **DOM** manipulation
- **AJAX**/**FETCH** request
- Using **Third-party libraries**
- **problem-solving** : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
- Debugging using the console
- Understand the notion of **"separation of concerns"**

## La "mission" de l'exercice:

"You work in the Multimedia department of one of the European Union institutions. This morning, Johnny Hasnoclew, your Project Manager, sends you on a mission: one of the in-house journalists has published a new article on the institution's website. The article in question is already integrated with an **html** / **css** / **Javascript file**.

He asks you to make it more _rich_, more _interactive_, more... _sexy_ (The use of that specific adjective indicates that Johnny certainly worked in advertising before, the poor guy).

That's exactly what you're going to do, by adding two **interactive data visualisation graphics** using javascript. These graphs will be interactive in the sense that the user can manipulate the graph, such as filtering data, or reveal detailed data when the mouse hovers over it. You are free to design the interaction in your project."
